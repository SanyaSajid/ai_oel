Problem Statement:
Optimization problems often require finding the best possible solution from a large, complex
search space. Traditional optimization methods can struggle with challenges such as non-linearity,
multiple local minima, or high-dimensionality. This project addresses the problem of minimizing
user-defined mathematical equations using a Genetic Algorithm (GA).
The goal is to determine the value of x that minimizes the given equation by evolving a population
of candidate solutions over successive generations. The algorithm utilizes genetic operators,
including selection to retain the bestsolutions, crossover to combine parent solutions, and mutation
to introduce variability. By mimicking the process of natural evolution, the GA provides a robust
and efficient approach to solving mathematical optimization problems.
